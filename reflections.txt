Your response goes here!

  I've learnt what html stands for, how to set up an html page, main tags and what they are used for, I also had a brief
  introduction to what is one of the jobs of a web developer translate a pdf into a html document and I also learnt the
  what is the family tree in web development.

  Almost all the challanges were easy because I already had some knowledge about HTML

  Nothing yet

  I started by doing some research for tags that I did not know yet and after finding them and understanding how to use
  them I used them.
